    Apply feature distances weighting to calculate fingerprint distances.

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_distances_path : str or pathlib.Path
        Path to feature distances CSV or CSV.bz2 file.
    feature_weights : None or list of float
        Feature weights of the following form:
        (i) None
            Default feature weights: All features equally distributed to 1/15
            (15 features in total).
        (ii) By feature (list of 15 floats):
            Features to be set in the following order: size, hbd, hba, charge, aromatic,
            aliphatic, sco, exposure, distance_to_centroid, distance_to_hinge_region,
            distance_to_dfg_region, distance_to_front_pocket, moment1, moment2, and moment3.
            All floats must sum up to 1.0.
    fingerprint_distances_path : None or str or pathlib.Path
        Path to output fingerprint distances CSV or CSV.bz2 file.

    kissim.comparison.FingerprintDistanceGenerator
        Pairwise fingerprint distances.
